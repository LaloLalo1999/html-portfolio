<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, I'm Eduardo Javier García López, but most people call me Lalo. Welcome to my corner of the internet.</p>

<p>
I'm currently a Computer Systems Engineering student at ITESO in Jalisco, Mexico, and I am deeply passionate about 
all things tech. My primary interest lies in AI and software development, but I also have a knack for various 
programming languages, including Python, C, JAVA, and JavaScript. Recently, I've embarked on the journey of learning 
Rust and sharpening my skills through a full-stack web development course.
</p>

<p>
My academic pursuits and professional aspirations don't just define me, though. Beyond being a tech enthusiast, 
I am a lover of martial arts. I've trained in MMA, with a special fondness for Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai. The discipline, 
resilience, and focus I've developed from MMA training often seep into my approach to coding, pushing me to 
continuously improve and face challenges head-on.
</p>

<p>
I also have a keen interest in video gaming and meditation. Gaming is not just a hobby; it's a passion that feeds my 
creativity and fuels my problem-solving skills, which come in handy when tackling complex coding problems. Meditation, 
on the other hand, is my sanctuary. It helps me manage stress, enhances my self-awareness, and provides a counterbalance 
to the fast-paced world of technology.
</p>

<p>
Living with ADHD and Bipolar Disorder type 2, I've learned to channel the unique strengths of these conditions while
continuously developing strategies to navigate their challenges. This journey shapes my perspective and enriches my work 
as I strive to build inclusive, accessible, and user-friendly digital solutions.
</p>

<p>
I'm excited by the endless possibilities of technology and am continuously pushing my boundaries in this ever-evolving 
field. Whether I'm working on a new project, learning a new language, or exploring the vast world of AI, I'm always eager 
to engage with fellow tech enthusiasts and potential collaborators.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for taking the time to learn a little more about me. If you're interested in my work or have an exciting 
project in mind, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to new challenges and collaborations.
